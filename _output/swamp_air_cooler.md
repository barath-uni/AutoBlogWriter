## Introduction




A swamp cooler is a device that helps cool the air in a room or building. Swamp coolers work by evaporating water, which causes the air to cool. There are a few different ways to install a swamp cooler, but the most common is to install it on the roof. Installing a swamp cooler on the roof has several benefits, including:

1) It keeps the cooler out of the sun, which prevents it from overheating.
2) It is more efficient than installing a swamp cooler in a window.
3) It is less likely to be affected by wind than a swamp cooler that is installed on the ground.
4) It can keep the building cooler when the weather is hot and dry.

1. Locate the studs in your roof and mark them with a pencil.

2. Drill pilot holes into the studs using a drill bit that is slightly smaller than the screws you will be using.
