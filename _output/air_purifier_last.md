## Types of air purifier filters


 

Air purification systems come with a wide range of filtration options, each with their own unique design and abilities. The most common types are HEPA filters, activated carbon filters, and ionizers. HEPA filters use fibers to capture particles as small as 0.3 microns in size from the air passing through it. Activated carbon filters can absorb chemicals and fumes from the atmosphere while ionizers charge particles so they can be attracted to metal plates like a magnet. Depending on your specific needs, you may need more than one type of filter in your system.

HEPA filters are made up of fine fibers which capture pollutants such as pollen, dust mites, pet dander and other airborne allergens from the air passing through it. The most efficient HEPA filters have an efficiency rating of 99.97 percent or higher for capturing these pollutants from the air, however some lower quality ones may only filter out 80-90 percent of them. Activated carbon filters are composed of charcoal or other activated materials and work by trapping gases and odors in its porous structure. Ionizers work by charging particles so that they can be attracted to metal plates like a magnet and then removed from circulation in the room’s atmosphere. 

Each type of filter has different lifespans depending on how often it is used and what type of environment it is placed into. The more polluted an area is, the less time each filter will last before needing to be replaced due

When it comes to replacing your air purifier filter, the frequency of replacement depends on a variety of factors. The most important factor is how often you use the system. For example, if you're running your air purifier constantly or in a large space with high levels of indoor air pollution, you may need to replace your filters more frequently than if you were running it in a smaller room for only a few hours each day. Additionally, different types of filters have different lifespans; HEPA filters tend to last longer than carbon-based ones. The quality of the filter also plays a role; lower quality filters may need to be replaced more often than higher quality ones. Finally, environmental conditions in your home can influence how quickly the filter becomes clogged and needs to be replaced. 

In general, it's recommended that you change out your air purifier filter every 12 months in order to maintain its performance and efficiency. However, if you're noticing decreased airflow or an increase in allergens and pollutants circulating in your home despite recent filter changes, then you may need to replace them sooner. It’s best to consult with an HVAC expert or manufacturer's representative before making any decisions about when and how often should you replace an air purifier filter.
