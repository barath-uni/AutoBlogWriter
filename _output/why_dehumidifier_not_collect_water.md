## Introduction


: Dehumidifiers are essential appliances for those living in high humidity areas. They help regulate the humidity level in the air, and reduce the risk of mold and mildew growth. However, when your dehumidifier suddenly stops collecting water despite the room temperature being above 65 degrees Fahrenheit it can be a source of frustration! In this article we will explore why your dehumidifier might not be collecting moisture, what to look out for, and how you can fix it. 

Causes of a Dehumidifier Not Collecting Water: There are several common reasons why your dehumidifier may not be collecting water. The most likely cause is that the water tank is full and needs to be emptied. Additionally, parts of the unit may need to be cleaned or there could be an issue with coils on refrigerant-based systems. It's also possible that the moisture level in the room has already been set too low or too high. 

Average Time for a Dehumidifier to Fill a Collection Tank: On average, most dehumidifiers begin to collect water as soon as they are switched on. Depending on the size of your unit’s collection tank, it usually takes between 6-8 hours for a 2-liter tank to fill up completely with moisture from the air. 

How To Check If The Compressor Is Running: If your dehumidifier has stopped collecting water even though you have verified that the ambient room


## Causes of a dehumidifier not collecting water




There can be a number of causes for a dehumidifier not collecting water even though the room temperature is over 65 degrees Fahrenheit. The most common cause is that the water tank has become full and needs to be emptied. Additionally, parts of the unit may need to be cleaned or there could be an issue with coils on refrigerant-based systems. It's also possible that the moisture level in the room has been set too low or too high. This means that your dehumidifier isn't getting enough air to draw moisture out of it, thus resulting in no condensation being collected. If you have ruled out these other potential problems and are still experiencing issues, then it’s likely due to an issue with your dehumidifier compressor. 

The compressor is responsible for circulating refrigerant through the evaporator coil which extracts moisture from the air. When this part fails, it will prevent your unit from collecting any water at all. There are several reasons why your compressor might fail, including defective wiring, faulty overload devices, age related wear and tear or a lack of regular maintenance. 

If you suspect that your dehumidifier's compressor is failing then you should contact a professional technician as soon as possible for assistance. They will be able to diagnose the problem accurately and advise you on how best to repair or replace it if necessary.

Depending on the size of your unit’s collection tank, it usually takes between 6-8 hours for a 2-liter tank to fill up with moisture. The amount of time taken for larger tanks may vary depending on how powerful the dehumidifier is. 

How to Check If the Compressor Is Running : To check if your dehumidifier's compressor is running, you should look for an indicator light that confirms whether or not it is operating. Usually this light will turn green when the compressor is running and red when it isn't. If the blower in the dehumidifier is running but there is still no indication from the indicator light, then you can be sure that there are issues with your compressor. 

Reasons Why the Compressor May Not Be Working : There are several potential reasons why your dehumidifier's compressor may not be working correctly. One possible cause could be that its overload device has failed or become damaged due to overuse or age. Additionally, if there are any faulty electrical connections within components such as capacitors, relays or contactors then they may need replacing in order to get your system back up and running again. 

Maintenance Tips and Advice : Regular maintenance of your dehumidifier can help ensure that it continues to run efficiently and effectively over time. Make sure that filters

: If your dehumidifier is running but not collecting water, it is likely that the compressor is not operating. To check this, look at the indicator light on your dehumidifier and make sure that it is confirming that the compressor is running properly. Additionally, you can check to see if the blower in the unit is running as well. 

Reasons why the compressor may not be working: There are several reasons why the compressor in a dehumidifier might fail to work. One of these reasons could be due to an overload device failure. Additionally, a lack of electricity or a dirty filter could cause problems with the compressor as well. 

Maintenance Tips and Advice: It's important to regularly clean and maintain your dehumidifier in order to keep it running smoothly. Make sure to empty out its collection tank when necessary and replace its filters every few months. Additionally, you should periodically inspect all parts of the machine for any visible signs of damage or debris buildup. 

Conclusion: Dehumidifiers can sometimes stop collecting water for various reasons - from full tanks to faulty compressors - but luckily there are ways that you can address these issues without having to call a professional repairman. With regular maintenance and some troubleshooting tips, you should be able to get your unit back up and running again in no time!


## Reasons why the compressor may not be working


: If the blower in the dehumidifier is running but there is no indication that the compressor is operating, it may be due to a faulty overload device. This device prevents damage to the compressor by cutting off power when it overheats or senses an electrical fault. Other causes include an issue with the electronic control board, a weak motor capacitor, or a bad start relay. 

Maintenance Tips and Advice: To keep your dehumidifier in top condition and to prevent issues like this from occurring again, it's important to regularly clean and maintain your unit. Make sure you empty out the collection tank regularly and if possible, use a vacuum cleaner hose to remove any dust build-up from around the coils and filters. Additionally, replace your filter once per year as part of regular maintenance. 

Conclusion: Dehumidifiers are essential appliances for those living in high humidity areas but they can sometimes run into trouble. When you find that your dehumidifier isn’t collecting water even though the room temperature is over 65 degrees Fahrenheit, it likely means that there's an issue with its compressor which can be caused by several factors such as a faulty overload device or weak motor capacitor. With regular cleaning and maintenance however, you can keep these problems at bay and ensure your unit runs efficiently for years to come!


## Maintenance tips and advice


 : In order to maintain your dehumidifier, make sure to clean the filter often and empty the collection tank when it's full. Additionally, if you notice a decrease in air flow or an increase in noise from the unit, it may be time to check for any clogs or blockages.

Conclusion: Dehumidifiers are an important investment for anyone living in high humidity areas. If you find that your dehumidifier is not collecting water even after following these steps, then it's likely time to call a professional repair person to take a look at the unit.


## Conclusion


: Dehumidifiers are an essential appliance to keep your home humidity at a comfortable level. If your dehumidifier isn’t collecting water even though the ambient room temperature is above 65 degrees Fahrenheit, it likely means that the compressor is not working. As we have discussed, the compressor can fail for a number of reasons such as the overload device failing or parts needing to be cleaned or replaced. Regular maintenance and cleaning of your dehumidifier will help keep it functioning properly.
